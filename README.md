# Song-Lyrics-Analysis
A comparison of song lyric text across music genres

Personal project, September 2018 (in process)

Summary: I conduct a few analyses to explore whether song lyrics vary significantly across music genres.

(1) I create word clouds of top words from various music genres. Metal is noticeably different from other genres.

(2) I compare sentiments (ranging from 1 = positive to -1 = negative) for across genres. On average, jazz
 and country lyrics have the most positive sentiments, and hip-hop and metal lyrics have the least positive sentiments. However, the differences between genres are relatively small, on average.
 
(3) I build a predictive model that will predict whether lyrics belong to a metal song or a pop song. When I test my model on several lyrics (that are roughly half metal and half pop), my model predicts the correct genre 85% of the time.
